0:1:Excuse me? Are you Laune?:0
0:2:Hello! I'm... New here.:0
1:0:Huh? Yes... Who are you? Wait a second...| You're a human! Gross!:0
1:3:I'm new... Do you have a problem with |humans?:0
1:4:Gross? I'm sorry. Well I'm not here to |cause trouble. I'm looking for someone.:0
2:0:New? A human...? That's weird. Anyway, |I'm Laune. What do you want?:0
2:5:I'm looking for a girl named Ziva, |she's somewhere in the school |and I wonder if I could borrow |your key so I could go into |the next part of the school.:0
2:6:That's a beautiful name!:0
2:7:You look weird, what are you?:0
3:0:Hmm... Not really, this is the |first time I've met one. I heard |they're supposed to smell really |badly. But you don't smell |like more than flesh, blood and |maybe a bit of dirt.:0
3:8:Uh... That's good. I suppose. |Could you help me?:0
4:0:Better not! Else I'll give you |a good whooping. Who are you |looking for?:0
4:5:Her name is Ziva. I need your |key to find her.:0
5:0:Ziva? She's brought a human to |the school? Just perfect. |She's always causing trouble. Wait, |you want my key? Why would I |give it to you? You're an |outsider.:0
5:9:Please, I need it to search for |her, she took me here so |she probably knows how to bring me |back.:0
5:10:Because else this outsider might |beat you up.:0
6:0:You think so? No one's ever said |that before. Thank you! |Uhm... Oh right- Did you need |something?:0
6:11:Totally! If you don't mind... I |would like to borrow your| key so I can go into the next |area...?:0
6:12:Not really, haha! Kind of an ugly |name. I need your key |though.:0
7:0:Weird!? Rude! For you information- |I'm a lamia! I should |smack you for that!:0
7:8:I'm sorry, that was really mean. |Would you be up for |helping me?:0
7:14:You could try!:0
8:0:Depends on what it is you need |help with.:0
8:9:I'm looking for a girl named Ziva, she's somewhere in the school and I wonder if I could borrow your key so I could go into the next part of the school.:0
8:9:Please, I need it to search for |her, she took me here so |she probably knows how to bring |me back.:0
9:0:Hmm... I understand. If you really |need it then I'd be mean |to refuse. Here.:1
10:0:You think you can scare me, human? |You looking for a fight?! :0
10:8:I'm sorry, that was really mean. |Would you be up for helping |me?:0
11:0:Well... I suppose. But only |because you're so sweet.:1
12:0:What!? You son of a- :2
13:0:Watch me!:2
14:0:Draw your sword, if you even |have one!:1
