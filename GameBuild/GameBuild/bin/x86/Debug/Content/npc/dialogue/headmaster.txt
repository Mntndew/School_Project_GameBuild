2:0: I felt a disturbance in the magical | barriers, I had a feeling someone | had breached the realms. | Seems like I was right.:0
2:3: M-magical barriers...? Realms?! | What are you talking abo-:0
3:0: So tell me, how did you manage something | like that? Speak quickly before | I beat the living daylight out of you.:0
3:4: O- oh no no no! Wait here just a moment! | I haven't done anything!:0
4:0: Yet you're here, Little one.:0
4:5: B-but there was this- this girl... I met | her in the wood and then  | she took me here... She said her | name was Ziva!:0
5:0: Ziva. *sigh* Of course. She's always going | around, causing trouble. Let me explain | something, kid. You're not on earth | anymore, this is a school in a completely | different universe. Things live here that | you'd never see on earth. The students | here aren't human, like yourself.:0

6:0: Beats me.:0
